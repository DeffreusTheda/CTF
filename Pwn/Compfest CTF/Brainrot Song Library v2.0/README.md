## Description

Seeing his son's unsafe program, David, Little John's dad, upgraded the Brainrot Song Library. David implemented heaps for this! Which means you can now store longer lyrics and add or remove songs from the library. You can also choose whether to store short lyrics or long lyrics. And it should be safe. At least...that's what he thought. nc challenges.ctf.compfest.id 9017 [chall](https://ctf.compfest.id/files/c8b603fea51af887c60142a18d109a06/chall?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3MiwidGVhbV9pZCI6MzA3LCJmaWxlX2lkIjo3Nn0.ZtLjbg.lRqhyGprGfQnweA3JOdhX_ElKBo) [ld-2.31.so](https://ctf.compfest.id/files/3254ee1b262ee3885a1f1f0b205c2d40/ld-2.31.so?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3MiwidGVhbV9pZCI6MzA3LCJmaWxlX2lkIjo3N30.ZtLjbg.PNsvzbNRO2AHWe8dgww6xQZE57M) [libc.so.6](https://ctf.compfest.id/files/afab2f876dacd00bb1bb78d88b43d0f0/libc.so.6?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3MiwidGVhbV9pZCI6MzA3LCJmaWxlX2lkIjo3OH0.ZtLjbg.KXGQf7bkn8TiXoBI_an9_sg_6Zs)
