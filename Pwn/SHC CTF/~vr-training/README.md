I was part of the Army's Force XXI Trials...
Force XXI?
Thats about tactical IT deployment right?
Any field experience?
No -- not really.
So this is your first.
I've had extensive training --
the kind that's indistinguishable from the real thing.
Like what?
Sneaking Mission 60, Weapons 80, Advanced --
VR, huh.

Hint: Around %30$p
