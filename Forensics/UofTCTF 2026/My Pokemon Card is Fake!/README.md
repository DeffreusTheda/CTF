Han Shangyan noticed that recently, Tong Nian has been getting into Pokemon cards. So, what could be a better present than a literal prototype for the original Charizard? Not only that, it has been authenticated and graded a PRISTINE GEM MINT 10 by CGC!!!

Han Shangyan was able to talk the seller down to a modest 6-7 figure sum (not kidding btw), but when he got home, he had an uneasy feeling for some reason. Can you help him uncover the secrets that lie behind these cards?

What you will need to find:

    Date and time (relative to the printer, and 24-hour clock) that it was printed.

    Printer's serial number.

The flag format will be uoftctf{YYYY_MM_DD_HH:MM_SERIALNUM}

Example: uoftctf{9999_09_09_23:59_676767676}

Notes:

    You're free to dig more into the whole situation after you've solved the challenge, it's very interesting, though so much hasn't been or can't be said :(

    Two days after I write this challenge, I'm going to meet the person whose name was used for all this again. Hopefully I'll be back to respond to tickets!!!
