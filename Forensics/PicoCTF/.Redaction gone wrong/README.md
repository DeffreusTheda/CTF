## Description

Now you DONâ€™T see me.<br>
This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/84/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

	How can you be sure of the redaction?

## Files

```
$ file Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf 
Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf: PDF document, version 1.7, 1 pages
```

## Solution

I open the file in my browser,
Brave!

![page](./page.png)

I noticed that my cursor would change when hovering the redacted box,
I then tried to drag and select it...
It works?

I just did CTRL+A and copy it here:

```
Financial Report for ABC Labs, Kigali, Rwanda for the year 2021.
Breakdown - Just painted over in MS word.

Cost Benefit Analysis
Credit Debit
This is not the flag, keep looking
Expenses from the
picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully}
Redacted document.
```

Yup!
Easy!

FLAG: `picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully}`
