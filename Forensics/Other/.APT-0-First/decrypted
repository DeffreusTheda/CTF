Finally got some idiot at the hospital down the street to open my phishing link. It was just a word doc with a macro on it that opened up powershell and downloaded my ransomware LOL. I got access to their DC and encrypted their entire network. I'm demanding 2,500,000 million in BTC from them now. They said they would pay 1,000,000 and that really pissed me off so now im raising their price to 3,000,000.
