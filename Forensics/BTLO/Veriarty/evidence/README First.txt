Sherlock,

One of our operatives working closely within Moriarty's crime organisation was able to intercept a communication between between James and one of his generals. There's a high probability this communication relates to a meeting which is to take place where they will be discussing the next steps in their plans to destabilise the world's economy.

We've been unable to crack this stream, but think it's some kind of encrypted container. The only thing we know is AES and SHA256 have been used to secure the information. Can you or Watson take a look, please?

I can't stress the urgency of this, Sherlock.
