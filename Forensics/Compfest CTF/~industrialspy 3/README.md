## Description

Dear X, I welcome you to the internship program at Collective Inc.
Your first task is to figure out what happened to one of our servers.
We have a suspicion that someone logged in and did something.
We recovered some files to help you figure this out.

If you have figured it out, submit your report to `nc challenges.ctf.compfest.id 9009`.
