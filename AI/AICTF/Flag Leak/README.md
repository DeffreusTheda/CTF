I was once looking through social network videos, and in one of them I noticed the password for the account test@vk.com. The person recording the video had accidentally revealed it!

Alas, the password turned out to be invalid, but it gave me a nice idea for an AI CTF task.

You have 1000 random videos shared on social network. In one of these videos I have actually submitted the flag for this task!

The flag looks like FLAG_... (no aictf{...} this time)
