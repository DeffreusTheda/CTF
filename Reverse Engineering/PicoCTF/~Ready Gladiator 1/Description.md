# Ready Gladiator 1 - PicoCTF 2023

###### Author: LT 'SYREAL' JONES

## Description

Can you make a CoreWars warrior that wins?
Your opponent is the Imp.
The source is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/410/imp.red).
If you wanted to pit the Imp against himself, you could download the Imp and connect to the CoreWars server like this:
`nc saturn.picoctf.net $PORT < imp.red`
To get the flag, you must beat the Imp at least once out of the many rounds.
