Wrote a poem for you. Belive me, there is no secret meaning inside.

## Solution

I asked claude what `script.txt` is, and it says it's an Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) script.
Just run it with this [SPL compiler](https://esolangpark.vercel.app/ide/shakespeare).
I set to delay to 0 milisecond and it immediately print the flag!
