Tony Tony Chopper stood at the Thousand Sunnyâs rail, nose twitching at the sting of salt and snow. The horizon was a crooked line of white cliffs and frosted pinesâWintermelon Island, the log poseâs latest whim. Behind him, Luffy had already declared three things: he was starving, the island looked delicious, and snowball fights were mandatory.

âIâm going ashore to check for herbs,â Chopper announced, trying to sound like a serious doctor instead of a reindeer who really liked snow. âRare alpine plants grow in environments like this.â

âBring back something we can stew!â Sanji called, puffing smoke into the crisp air.

âAnd something we can sell,â Nami added, all business, âpreferably not our ship.â

âDonât get lost,â Zoro said, immediately turning left when the gangplank went right.

Chopper hopped to the dock, hooves making squeaky prints. The snow here smelled familiarâlike the crisp bite of Drum Island wintersâbut under it was a different scent: pine resin, river ice, andâ¦smoke? He lifted his head. Thin gray threads rose from the trees inland.

âMaybe a village,â Robin said, stepping onto the snow as if it were glass. âOr a fire.â

Chopper swallowed. Fires made people sick, and sick people needed doctors. âIâll go check!â he said, already trotting toward the tree line.

He shifted into Walk Point for speed, little legs lengthening, hooves drumming a quick rhythm over the frost. The forest welcomed him with needles whispering secrets. He passed mushrooms with caps like tiny red umbrellas, a brook glazed with a sugar sheen of ice, and a gullâs abandoned footprintâwebbed and curiousâpressed into the bank. The smoke was stronger now andâ¦mingled with something bitter, a chemical tang that made his throat close.

Chopper slowed near a clearing. A low wooden lodge sat half-buried in snow, its roof a sugared cake. At the door, a hand-painted sign read: âHearth Clinic.â His heart did a little flip. A clinic! He peeked inside.

The interior was warm and tidy, despite the sour smell. Vials slept in racks, books dozed open under string-bound bookmarks, and in the center, a metal stove glowed like a gentle heart. On a cot near the back lay a young woman, pale as morning, breath quick and shallow.

âHello?â Chopper called softly. âIâm a doctor!â

A man stepped from behind a curtain, collar dusted with frost. He wore spectacles fogged by the roomâs breath and a wool scarf the color of ash. âIf this is more tax collection, take the door,â he said, voice frayed.

âIâm not here for money,â Chopper blurted, stepping closer. âIâm Tony Tony Chopper. Iâm a doctor with the Straw Hat Pirates!â He hesitated, waiting for the usual stare. It came, soft and puzzled, then softened further.

âA reindeer doctor,â the man murmured. âWintermelon has seen stranger winters.â He pushed his glasses up. âIâm Doctor Larch. This is my daughter, Juniper.â He gestured toward the cot. âWe have a blight moving through the valley. It starts like a cough and ends with frost in the lungs, even next to the fire.â

Chopper climbed onto a stool, ears perked. He listened to Juniperâs chest. The breath rattled like pebbles in a jar, but it wasnât just fluidâsomething irritated the airways, inflaming them like nettles. He sniffed at the pot bubbling on the stove. Bitterleaf. Good for fever, butâ¦he lifted a vial, uncorked it, and recoiled. âThis tinctureâdid you brew with northern foxcap?â

Larch frowned. âOf course. Itâs standard.â

âNot during winter bloom.â Chopperâs eyes narrowed. âThe cold changes its oils. It can burn the lungs if the patient is already inflamed.â

Larchâs mouth tightened, pride biting. âWeâve used it for generations.â

Chopper smiled gently. âThen itâs about time generations learned something new.â

He moved quickly, hooves surprisingly sure among glass and paper. He found wild angelica in the hanging bundles, jars of honey as clear as amber song, and dried pine tipsâsmall green flames. He crushed, stirred, measured warmth with his palms. He boiled water to roll and sigh, not throw tantrums. He added a pinch of winter mint, more for comfort than chemistry. The room slowly smelled like a forest waking to spring.

âJuniper,â Chopper said, voice low, âthis will help your lungs open without angering them. Small sips.â

The girlâs eyes fluttered. âYour nose is blue,â she whispered, then drank.

Outside, the wind thumped against the shutters. Chopper checked the window: silhouettes moved at the treelineâtoo many to be deer. He squinted. The shapes clanked. Iron-clad. He knew that kind of sound.

âDoctor,â Larch said, following his gaze, âthe Baron is collecting âhearth duesâ for the snow melt. When the valley couldnât pay, his men took our firewood and oil. If the blight keeps people indoors, they canât work. If they canât workâ¦â He spread his hands. âThe Baron doesnât negotiate with winter.â

Chopperâs fur bristled. âTheyâre taking heat from sick people?â

âFrom everyone.â

A sharp knock hammered the door. âHearth tally!â a voice barked. âPay your due or your flame is forfeit.â

Larchâs face went chalk-white. Chopperâs hooves trembled with anger. He wasnât the crewâs fighterâthat was Zoro or Sanji or Jinbeâbut he knew something about cold and warmth. He also knew what happened to lungs without heat.

He took a breath. âDoctor Larch, keep Juniper drinking. Donât let the stew cool. Iâllâ¦talk to them.â He popped a Rumble Ball into his mouth. The sweet berry taste hit like lightning and sugar. His form balloonedâfur bristling, muscles banding, antlers arching like living branches. Monster Point filled the clinic, then folded into a leaner Guard Point with a whisper of downy armor. He opened the door.

The Baronâs menâsix of them, bundled in steel and greedâstumbled back at the sight of a towering reindeer with eyes full of northern thunder. The leader tried to sneer but landed somewhere around a whimper.

âUm. Hi,â Chopper said, realizing too late he still sounded likeâ¦Chopper. He cleared his throat, dropped into Heavy Point to look moreâ¦doctorly. âYou canât take heat from this clinic. Your policy is dangerous and un-medical. People will die.â

âOrders are orders.â The leader lifted a paper list. âPay or forfeit.â

Chopper looked past them, into the trees. Snow shook from a branch; a green-haired swordsman yawned from above. Zoroâs voice drifted down. âYou sure you donât need help?â

âStay hidden,â Chopper mouthedâthen remembered Zoro couldnât read lips, or directions. He turned back to the men. âIâll make you a deal,â he said. âYou let the clinic keep its fuel, and Iâll make sure the blight doesnât take the Baronâs best workers. Consider itâ¦preventative care for your wallets.â

They laughed. It wasnât a nice sound.

Behind Chopper, a gentle voice: âMr. Reindeer Doctor.â Juniper stood in the doorway, blanket around her shoulders, color peeking into her cheeks. âMay I show them how I can breathe?â

She inhaled. The rattle had softened, the nettles quieted.

The menâs laughter thinned. Money liked proof. âHowâ¦how long till she works again?â one asked, softening coldly.

âSheâs not working,â Larch snapped, finding his courage. âSheâs healing.â

Chopper took another breath. âWintermelon doesnât have to be cruel,â he said, letting his voice carry. âIf you keep stealing heat, there will be no labor left to tax. Iâll treat the village, but I need your assurance the clinic keeps its fuel. If notâ¦â He let Monster Point creep back into his shoulders, antlers cracking the doorframe with a polite splinter. âIâll tell my captain. He doesnât negotiate with bullies.â

A pause. Somewhere far off, a rubbery âmeatâ!â echoed across the snow. The men glanced at the trees, suddenly imagining all sorts of Straw Hats in all sorts of inconvenient places.

âFine,â the leader muttered, thrusting the list back into his coat. âThe clinic keeps its fuel. But the taxââ

âWill be reconsidered,â came a new voice. A figure stepped from the woods, cloak furred with frost, a crest glinting at the throat. The Baron himself, with cheeks too rosy to be kind. He looked at Juniper, then at Chopper, then at the clinicâs warm light bleeding into the dusk. âA sick village is a poor one. Consider this aâ¦pilot program.â

Chopper blinked. He hadnât expected it to be that easy. Then he noticed the faint imprint of a boot behind the Baron, the way his cloak fluttered where no wind blew, and the very polite silhouette of Robinâs hands resting where a spine met consequence. Ah.

âThank you, Baron,â Chopper said, bowing so hard his hat nearly fell.

That night, the Straw Hats turned the Hearth Clinic into a festival. Sanji cooked stews that steam-kissed the windows. Brook played songs that warmed toes. Usopp spun tales about a brave reindeer doctor who stared down a dragon (Chopper: âUsopp!â Usopp: âMetaphor, Chopper!â). Nami drew up a budget for âpilot programsâ with interest rates that mysteriously favored the poor. Franky and Jinbe ferried wood from the Sunnyâs stores. Zoro pretended he hadnât gotten lost. Luffy tried to race snowflakes.

And Chopper? He moved among the cots, spooning medicine, listening to lungs, whispering jokes. He taught Larch to brew the new tea, explaining the foxcapâs winter oils and the way cold can change a medicineâs temper. Larch listened, pride melting like icicles.

âYouâre a good doctor,â Larch said as the moon rose, fat and content.

Chopperâs cheeks went pink. âI know!âI meanâ¦thank you.â

In the morning, Wintermelon Island breathed easier. The cruel gray thread of smoke had thinned into something homier. As the Sunny slipped from the harbor, Juniper waved from the dock, a scarf bright as fresh berries. Chopper waved back until his shoulders ached.

Nami leaned on the rail. âNot bad, Doctor.â

Chopper puffed his little chest. âWinter medicine just needs winter hearts.â

Luffy dangled upside down from the figurehead. âChopper! Next island, letâs find a clinic shaped like a giant cake!â

Chopper laughed, the sound like bells thrown into a blue sky. âOnly if we treat the frosting responsibly.â

The snow came down in soft applause, and the Sunny sailed on.
