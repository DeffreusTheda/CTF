Yesterday I was approached by Harper from accounting that the printer does not work. How often do I have to tell them that I'm a software engineer and not IT support but she has good connections to Liam (who didn't bring cookies for his birthday like our company tradition states) which approves all the projects and I really really want a new macbook so maybe if I help her he budgets it for me.

Printers are such a mess too am I right? Always not working like they should - speaking of not working you know who never works too? Nelson from internal audit. Everytime I walk past his desk I see him on facebook (who uses facebook nowadays) or playing an obviously cracked version of minecraft. Legend has he has recreated the whole office in it though nobody has ever seen actual evidence of that.

Btw did I tell you that I booked vacation to Greece next month? I got a fantastic all-inclusive deal and can't wait to escape the ratrace for a while.

Anyway, back to the printer, I looked at the webinterface and it's like really old, maybe you can help me?
