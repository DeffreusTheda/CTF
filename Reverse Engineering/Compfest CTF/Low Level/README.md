## Description

I recently took a course in low level programming and made a program to simulate what you can do there. Can you find the flag?

It's another binary...
but it's HUGE, 60k lines?!
It's mostly just classes of some sort of a library,
something to do with `fmt`...
Noo, I don't think this is reversible without running it...

1. filter ip.dest=.1
2. It has pattern, and it seems like the password is `changeme`, cuz it stopped there.
3. see from table, check what hash it's, and crack it.
4. see from the sql, the only non-`SELECT` query
5. employee_id=6 -> see on the table
