tl;dr: 

find `main` by searching for prompt string,
analyze, and you'll see `check_flag`! jackpot!
there, it contruct the flag to memory,
using functions that return a character,
then comparing it to input, character by character.
we can peek at each of those to conctruct the flag ourself!
ez enough...
rust is so cryptic though... sigh.
