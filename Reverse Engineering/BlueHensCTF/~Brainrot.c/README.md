# brainrot.c Write-Up - BlueHensCTF 2024

## Basically...

I tried z3 but it got wrong at one point and I just don't want to troubleshoot it.
Looking at `brainrot.c`, it's not that complicated when you see through it.
I asked Claude-Sonnet 3.5 to un-brainrot the source code and got `solve.c`.
Just get the flag manually, it ain't that hard!
