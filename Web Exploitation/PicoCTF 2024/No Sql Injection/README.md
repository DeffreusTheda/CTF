As advised by the second hint, open up your burpsuite,
go to proxy and then your proxy browser thingy..
Set intercept on!
Go the the page link and login with both email and password: `{"$ne": null}`.
You'll get to the admin page.
See through your 'HTTP History',
and see the response to the POST request for login.
