## Description

Blake had a great idea.
If we set up at webapp that people can track their time on, then we can reward IT for working overtime on fixing this issue.
Naturally, Dave started working on this instead of fixing our windows machines. He has some kind of prototype running... I think.
I'm not sure it supports time tracking yet, but it uses this modern technology "JWT" so we know it's secure. 

## Solution

Login with `user`:`spongebob`, intercept the redirect, change to endpoint /admin and change `auth_token` to `admin_token`.
