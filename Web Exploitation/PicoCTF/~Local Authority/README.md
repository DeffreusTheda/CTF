## Description

Can you get the flag?<br>
Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:62231/) and see what you can discover.

This challenge launches an instance on demand.<br>

## Solution

Try to login, and we'll land in an 'Log In Failed' page.
Inspect it, and notice that there's a `secure.js` script,
presumably for password checking.

```secure.js



function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

That's the intended password in plain text!<br>
`strongPassword098765`
Should've done something to at least encrypt it...<br>
Now, let's login again with the correct credentials...

The page will now display the flag.

FLAG: `picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}`
