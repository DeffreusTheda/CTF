Turns out one of our workers in BEEFEST Corps is a mole planted here from an enemy company. He has stolen confidential information from our headquarters and ran away with it.

He has erased every single information about himself from our database and all that's left is this CV. Looks like there's fake information in it but let's hope it can be useful for your investigation. Don't let him get away with this, track down his real name and where he could possibly be hiding!

Seems like all his information is fake except for the GitHub link. Maybe we can find something useful there. SomethinG we can use to obtain his Maps. There's a tool to help you with that but I forgot the name. It's an "ultimate OSINT tool"!
